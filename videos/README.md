# videos/

Place two required videos here for grading:

1. demo.mp4 — A short non-technical demo showing the live webcam emote overlay.
2. walkthrough.mp4 — A technical walkthrough explaining the pipeline, model, and how to run training/eval/demo locally.

If you do not have the videos yet, keep this README and add the MP4s later. Filenames expected by graders:
- `videos/demo.mp4`
- `videos/walkthrough.mp4`
